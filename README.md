# Predicting Successful Landing of Rockets
IBM Capstone Project

The capstone project aims to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore it is crucial to determine determine if the first stage will land, as it can determine the cost of a launch. The project is divided into the following stages:

1. [Data Extraction using SpaceX API](https://github.com/vishalpuri13/spacex_landing_prediction/blob/master/data_collection.ipynb)
2. [Data Extraction by Webscraping Wikipedia Page](https://github.com/vishalpuri13/spacex_landing_prediction/blob/master/data_collection_webscrape.ipynb)
3. [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/vishalpuri13/spacex_landing_prediction/blob/master/data_wrangling.ipynb)
4. [Exploration of data using SQL](https://github.com/vishalpuri13/spacex_landing_prediction/blob/master/eda_using_sql.ipynb)
